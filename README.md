# Hello! I'm Anna

I'm a tech enthusiast with experience working on full-stack solutions for public sector clients built with React, .NET, and AWS. I’m currently enrolled in a community college program focused on cybersecurity concepts, gaining hands-on skills in ethical hacking and C++.

## Background, Technical Skills & Experience

Over the course of my work, I’ve been fortunate to work on interesting projects and have gained experience in frontend and backend development, test automation, deployment support, and requirements gathering. I’ve contributed to applications that handle background checks for firearm purchases, traffic accident reporting, and, if you live in Chicago and drive a car, the wheel tax vehicle sticker application 😄.

Here's a list of technologies I've had experience with so far:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** JS/TS, React, C#/.NET, Python, SQL
- **Testing:** Cypress, XUnit, Postman
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, Cloudwatch, IAM, VPC)
- **Tools & Skills:** REST APIs, Docker

## Let's Connect

I haven't been active a ton lately, but I have several ideas for building cybersecurity-focused applications to deepen my understanding of containerization, authentication, and SIEM. If you’re interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out.
