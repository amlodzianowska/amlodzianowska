# Hello! I'm Anna

I'm Anna Mlodzianowska, a full-stack developer with over two years of experience building software for public sector clients in a consulting role. I work primarily with React, .NET, and AWS, contributing to real-world applications that support government services and operations.

## My Background

My path into tech has been a mix of formal education and self-directed learning, driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how the different parts and processes of software development fit together. I transitioned into the field through consulting experience, supported by continuous learning and technical training. I hold a degree in architecture, which shaped my eye for thoughtful design and taught me to approach complex systems with structured, analytical thinking.

I'm currently seeking my next professional opportunity-one that allows me to apply my growing skillset to real-world challenges and continue developing practical, impactful software.

## Technical Skills & Experience

My background spans frontend and backend development, test automation, deployment support, and working on projects with legal and operational requirements. I've contributed to applications that handle background checks, traffic accident reporting, licensing workflows, and customer support systems.

Here's a list of technologies I've had experience with so far:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** JS/TS, React, Next.js, C#/.NET, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL
